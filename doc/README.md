## Project Limitations

### Prototype Boundaries:
- Non-functional prototype with simulated interactions only.
- Static map interface (no zoom/pan functionality).
- Predefined navigation routes and stop suggestions.
- Demonstration-only business and moderator roles.

### Known Issues:
- **Map Limitations**: Fixed route visuals without interactive controls.
- **Visual Mockups Only**: Features like caravan syncing and business verification have no backend functionality.  
- **No Data Validation**: Input fields accept any data without validation.  

## Future Development:
After we conducted our final testing with the users, the issues present have been documented and prioritized. These concerns will be addressed in future iterations to enhance usability, accessibility, and overall user satisfaction.

Some issues have already been resolved as part of recent updates based on user feedback:

- **Notification System Improvements**:  
  A new colored circle icon has been added next to the hamburger menu/drop-down button to indicate when users have new or unread notifications. This provides a more prominent visual cue to improve awareness of new activity across the app.

- **Back Button Behavior**:  
  The back button has been standardized across all screens in terms of both placement and function, reducing user confusion and improving navigation consistency.

- **Feature Clarity**:  
  Each of the friends, caravan, and business screens now includes a **"Need Help? Click Here!"** link. This directs users to a dedicated help screen that clearly explains the purpose and functionality of each feature, ensuring users can quickly understand how to engage with these parts of the application.

- **Home Button Visibility**:  
  The existing home button (Hermes logo) on the sidebar has been labeled with the word “Home” underneath, making it easier to identify and access.

- **Toggle Switch Indicators**:  
  Toggle switches in the settings page now use green and red backgrounds to clearly indicate on/off states for better visual feedback.

Remaining concerns, including layout spacing, theming options, and customization usability, will be the focus of upcoming development iterations.
